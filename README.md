# Optimization budget allocation

This project focuses on Linear Programming, Integer Programming, and Optimization Techniques using Gurobi.

The project's aim is to develop an Optimal Budget Allocation Strategy. As marketing budgets now constitute 11% of the total company budgets, it's crucial to ensure the effective allocation of these resources. The effectiveness of marketing can vary significantly, and one contributing factor is how marketing budgets are allocated across various advertisement platforms. To address this challenge, we employ linear programming to construct a straightforward yet effective marketing budget allocation strategy.
